\title{Compose model results}
\usage{
ems_compose(cmf_path, which = c("all", "variable", "coefficient"), name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{cmf_path}{Character length 1 (default is \code{NULL}), path to
the cmf file generated by \code{\link[=ems_deploy]{ems_deploy()}} or created via an
"in-situ" run with \code{\link[=ems_solve]{ems_solve()}}.}

\item{which}{Character length 1, type of data to parse (default
includes all). Choices:
\itemize{
\item \code{"all"}: All model variables and coefficients
\item \code{"variable"}: Percentage change values for model variables
\item \code{"coefficient"}: Values for model coefficients
}}

\item{name}{Character vector, a subset of the selected type
filtered by name.}
}
\value{
A list containing the parsed model results according
to the specified type.
}
\description{
\code{ems_compose()} retrieves and processes results
from a solved model run. Results are parsed according to the
specified type (variables, coefficients, or base data). Data
validation and consistency checks are performed during the
parsing process.
