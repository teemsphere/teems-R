\usage{
\method{ems_shock}{uniform}(var, type = "uniform", value, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{var}{Character of length 1, the variable to be shocked.}

\item{type}{Character of length 1, the type of shock. Choices:
\itemize{
\item \code{"uniform"}: a homogenous shock applied to the specified
variable \code{"var"} or variable elements (using \code{...}) at the
specified \code{"value"}.
\item \code{"custom"}: a user-specified granular shock applied to
variable \code{"var"} and aggregated set-specific variable tuples
according to percentage-change values.
\item \code{"scenario"}: a user-specified granular shock for temporally dynamic
models applied to variable \code{"var"} and unaggregated tuples
according to values specified in \code{"input"}. \code{"scenario"}
shocks must encompass all values associated with tuples
corresponding to unaggregated set elements. Values in
}}

\item{value}{Numeric length 1, value of uniform shock.}

\item{...}{One or more variable-specific key-value pairs
separated by commas corresponding to the parts of a variable
that will receive a uniform shock.}
}
\description{
\code{ems_shock.uniform()} loads uniform shocks for
processing as well as conducts a series of compatibility
checks. A uniform shock is one which applies a homogenous
value across all or part of a variable (using \code{...}).  The
accepted values for \code{...} depend on the \code{"var"} specified
and set mappings associated with this variable. If a uniform
shock is to be carried out, the output of this function is a
required input to the \code{"shock"} argument within the
\code{\link[=ems_deploy]{ems_deploy()}} function.

\examples{
# fully uniform: all variable elements receive the same shock value
afeall_full <- ems_shock(var = "afeall",
                         type = "uniform",
                         value = 2)

# partially uniform: applied only to the "chn" element in set REGr (REG)
# Note that set designations must consiste of the concatenation of the
# standard set (e.g., REG) and variable-specific index (e.g., r).
afeall_chn <- ems_shock(var = "afeall",
                        type = "uniform",
                        REGr = "chn",
                        value = 2)
